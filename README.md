## ipython and vim in terminal with tmux
+ * may require iterm2 to run properly
+ config allows tmux split, with vim in one pane and ipython repl in the other, to share a clipboard.
+ can yank multiple lines in vim and run in ipython with magic %paste command
+ atm, these are my full configs; think you only need clipboard settings from both config files to work
+ only tested on mac
